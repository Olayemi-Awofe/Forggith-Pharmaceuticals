Forggith provided a template for their distributors to capture records of their sales which are then sent to Forggith on a monthly basis. This data is then used for reporting and analysis by Forggith to achieve their goals Sales and Marketing objectives through tracking and monitoring of KPIs.

In their efforts to maximise growth, Forggith works with a team of Sales and Marketing pros who ensure retailers are able to get their products through the distributors. That is, Forggith does not sell directly to retailers or end-users, they sell to Distributors. But they maintain interaction with retailers, through their Sales and Marketing pros.
